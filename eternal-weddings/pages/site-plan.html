          <h3>FAQ page</h3>
          <p>
            Q: How invasive are the videographers?
            A: It just depends on how you want the video in the end! Our videographers can stay out
            of the way or they can be up close and personal. It just depends on what final product
            you are looking for!
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: What cameras do you use?
            A: We use Sony A7iii with a wide variety of G-Master lenses. We believe these cameras to
            be amongst the highest quality available to us. We also use a few different gimbals to 
            make sure the video is smooth. Aerial footage is available upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: How does the video turn out?
            A: We always schedule a brainstorming session before the wedding day. This allows our
            videographers to fully understand the final product that the couple is looking for.
            These sessions typically take around one hour. Examples are available upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: Why do we need a wedding video?
            A: Memory isn't always perfect, but a video can refresh and capture more detail than 
            any human could remember. Our videos capture all the details so you can remember your
            special day for the rest of eternity!
